# What did I do for JSONAccelerator

- I fixed an issue about displaying:

Once you click "Option" button on Choice Folder panel view, the customer option view will show. But the "Option View" can not be fully shown. This is due to constrains. I fixed it, see below image:

# JSON Accelerator

JSON Accelerator helps developers from all programming language persuasions get data, verify it, and write model objects - Objective C, Java, or Python. Itâ€™s complexity, simplified.

## What does it do?

### Writes model objects, fast

JSON Accelerator writes Objective C, Java and Python Django models. You choose whether to use ARC or even generate core data models. Your time is valuable. This is simple.

### Fetches JSON from url or local files

Simply enter JSON content or fetch code from the web, delivered in exported model object files. Modify http headers using GET or POST to work with several web APIs.

### Consumes and validates JSON

Made by developers/for developers who prefer not to mess around, JSON Accelerator consumes web services and creates native code; stable, reliable output in three clicks.

### NSCoding compliant in Objective C models

It works as expected; bottom line, NSCoding compliance means it just works. JSON Accelerator also saves your work. And helps you work faster.
